Using MATLAB to study
- fundamental frequency and harmonics,
- the effect of phase,
- sinusoids with exponentially decaying envelopes,
- beat notes and amplitude modulation,
- chirp signals and frequency modulation

All of those can be found in "main1.m". 

Then, I use what I have learned so far to compose some music in "main2.m".
